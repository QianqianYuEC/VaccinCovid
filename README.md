# vaccinCovid

Dataset is "vaccin_covid.csv", the vaccination rate against Covid-19 for different countries in the world, data is from different sources. 

In the project, I create a program that reads a dataset into a relational database through SQLite in Python and then analyzes and visualizes the data.

The project includes three class files:
Class datahantering is created to clean data;
Class database is created to transform the dataset into a relational database; 
Class visualization is created to visualize data.

Code is written in an object-oriented manner and contains both private and public methods.
